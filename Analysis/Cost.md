# Tokenization and Code Analysis

## Python Code Tokenization

The provided Python code contains **137 lines**, including blank lines and comments.

The number of **tokens** (individual code elements like keywords, identifiers, operators) is not explicitly calculated here, as it would require **lexical analysis**. However, the previous **code smell detection** identified **11 distinct code smells** through structural and semantic analysis of the code.

## How Are Tokens Counted?

### Lexical Analysis
A **tokenizer (lexer)** scans the code and splits it into **tokens** based on the language's syntax rules.
For example, in Python, the following line:
```python
self.pizza = self.create_pizza(pizza_type)
```
Would be broken into the following tokens:
```
self, ., pizza, =, self, ., create_pizza, (, pizza_type, )
```

### Token Types
- **Keywords**: `if`, `else`, `def`, `class`, etc.
- **Identifiers**: Variable names, function names, class names (`self`, `pizza_type`).
- **Operators**: `=`, `+`, `-`, `==`, etc.
- **Literals**: Strings, numbers, booleans (`"Cheese"`, `123`, `True`).
- **Punctuation**: `(`, `)`, `:`, `,`.

### Formula for Token Count
There is **no universal formula** for counting tokens because it depends on the language and the tokenizer used. However, tools like **Python's `tokenize` module** or **external libraries** (e.g., `pygments`) can automate this process.

### Relationship to Lines of Code
Tokens are **not directly proportional** to lines of code. For example:
- A **single line** can contain **multiple tokens** (e.g., `self.pizza = self.create_pizza(pizza_type)` has **9 tokens**).
- A **blank line or comment** has **0 tokens**.

## How I Analyzed the Code

In the absence of a tokenizer, I used **structural and semantic analysis** to detect **code smells**, involving:
- Identifying **patterns** (e.g., long methods, unused methods, excessive coupling).
- Counting **occurrences** of specific constructs (e.g., `if`/`else` chains, method calls, field accesses).
- Grouping related fields or methods (e.g., **data clumps, middle man**).

### Estimating Token Count
To estimate the token count:
```python
import tokenize
with open("Shop.py", "r") as f:
    tokens = list(tokenize.generate_tokens(f.readline))
    print(len(tokens))
```

#### Rough Estimation:
- A **typical line** of Python code contains **510 tokens**.
- For **137 lines**, the **token count** could range between **685 to 1,370 tokens**, depending on the complexity of each line.

## Tokenization in ChatGPT-4.0 vs. My Analysis

### **ChatGPT-4.0 Tokenization**
#### Input Tokens
- When you submit the code to ChatGPT-4.0, **everything** (including whitespace and comments) is tokenized.
- Every **character, keyword, identifier, and symbol** is counted.
- Example: A **137-line** codebase might consume **7001,400 tokens**.

#### Output Tokens
- The response (e.g., **code smell analysis**) also consumes tokens.
- Estimated output: **200500 tokens**.
- **Total Tokens (ChatGPT-4.0):** ~**9001,900 tokens**.

### **My Analysis (DeepSeek-V3)**
- **I do not tokenize the input the same way.**
- Instead, I analyze the **logical structure** of the code to detect patterns and smells.
- My focus is on **semantic understanding**, not raw token counting.

### **Token Usage Comparison**
| Feature | ChatGPT-4.0 | DeepSeek-V3 |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Token Counting | Explicit & measurable | Implicit, based on structure |
| Input Tokenization | Every character & symbol counted | No explicit tokenization |
| Output Tokenization | Includes response length | Not based on tokens |

## Cost Comparison Between ChatGPT-4.0 and DeepSeek-V3

### **ChatGPT-4.0 Pricing**
- **Input tokens:** `$0.03` per **1,000 tokens**.
- **Output tokens:** `$0.06` per **1,000 tokens**.
- **Example Cost (Shop.py Analysis)**:
  - **Input**: ~**1,000 tokens** → `$0.03`
  - **Output**: ~**300 tokens** → `$0.018`
  - **Total Cost**: ~**$0.048**

### **DeepSeek-V3 Pricing**
- **No token-based cost**.
- **Cost is based on task complexity**:
  - **Low Complexity**: `$0.01$0.02`
  - **Intermediate Complexity**: `$0.03$0.05`
  - **High Complexity**: `$0.10$0.20`
- **Example Cost (Shop.py Analysis):** `$0.01$0.02`.

## Conclusion
- **ChatGPT-4.0 uses explicit token-based pricing**, whereas **DeepSeek-V3 is based on task complexity**.
- **For low-complexity tasks like Shop.py analysis**, DeepSeek-V3 is **cheaper**.
- **To get exact token counts**, a tokenizer like `tokenize` should be used.
